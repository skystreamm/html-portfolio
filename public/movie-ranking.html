<h1>The Best Anime Series and Movies Ever by Prajwalit</h1>
<h2>The Best Anime Series</h2>
<hr />
<hr />
<h3>The Big Three</h3>
<h4>1. Naruto </h4>
<p>If you want to start your anime journey, and also have a lot of patience.</p>
<h4>2. Bleach </h4>
<p>If you want peak story along with high levels of action and suspensful plot.</p>
<h4>3. One piece </h4>
<p> Watch this next after completing naruto if you want something similar to talk no jutsu.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Isekai Anime</h3>
<p> Here, all the rankings are mixed as all of them are the top of the top when it comes to isekai. So all of them kind of rank at the same place depending on peoples' tastes.</p>
<h4>1. Arifureta </h4>
<p> If you like some kind of betrayal to the main protagonist, and an epic retransformation, with full on gun action.<br />Avoid this if you cant handle gore and too much blood. </p>
<h4>2. Rising of The Shield Hero</h4>
<p>Same story of betrayal but with a twist, also this has less gore and blood, so it's kind of PG instead of R.</p>
<h4>3. Wise Man's GrandChild</h4>
<p>If you want an overpowered MC, but a completely family friendly series with no blood or gore, and almost all happy moments.</p>
<h4>4. Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious</h4>
<p>If you want an overpowered MC who is accompanied by a goddess who he has a history with, has a dark past and is filled with lots of comedy.</p>
<h4>5. Mushoko Tensei Jobless Reincarnation</h4>
<p>IF you can handle the complex storyline along with lots of akwardness, then do watch this.</p>
<h4>6. That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime</h4>
<p>If you want something to start isekai with, but it doesn't traumatise you with the gore or blood, then this is a must see show.</p>
<h4>7. In Another World With My Smartphone</h4>
<p>An isekai anime which is very underatted, but brings in a fresh new concept with a modern twist.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Sports Anime</h3>
<h4>1. Haikyuu </h4>
<p>This is the best sports anime out there on volleyball and in overall story catagory, do watch this as an entry to the sports anime genre.</p>
<h4>2. Yuri on Ice </h4>
<p>This is by far one of the few sports animes that rivals haikyuu, it has a small essence of boy love in it, but as an ice skating anime, this is the most realistic one ever with proper mesmerising routines and real ice skating music.</p>
<h4>3. Kuroko No Basket </h4>
<p>If you want to watch basketball as a team sport which doesn't mostly focus on a single MC. By far the best mixture of little bit of a supernatural spice up and pure basketball adrenaline rush.</p>
<h4>4. Ahiru No Sora </h4>
<p>If you want a basketball anime with a storyline following a single MC, watch this if you want the pure basketball experience with real life moves</p>
<h4>5. Yowamushi Pedal </h4>
<p>This is for those people who want to watch an anime on cycling and racing on it. Fairly nice show but requires a little bit of patience.</p>
